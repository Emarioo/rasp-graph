- [ ] Don't render missing points. Like we render points in a 7 days span and only have points for the last hour. Currently we repeat the first point which appears as a long line.
- [ ] Zoom and move graphs.
  
# settings page
- [ ] 2 boxes for specifying time and max value and if the humidity is above max value for that time we create a warning on the front page.
- [ ] Change min and max for y-axis on the diagram.

# Future
- [ ] Alarm if humidity is above 30% for 30 minutes.
